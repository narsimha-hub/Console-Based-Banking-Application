The Console-Based Login Page allows users to log in securely through a simple command-line interface. Users are prompted to enter their username and password to access their accounts.

For extra security, the system can use multi-factor authentication (MFA). After entering the correct login details, a verification code is sent to the userâ€™s registered email or phone. The user must enter this code to complete the login process. This ensures that only authorized users can access the account.

If a user forgets their password, they can select the "Forgot Password" option. A reset link is sent to their registered email, allowing them to set a new password. If the user enters incorrect login details multiple times, the system temporarily locks the account to prevent unauthorized access.
