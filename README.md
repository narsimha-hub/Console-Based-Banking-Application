The Login Page of the Banking Application is designed to make it easy and secure for users to access their accounts. Users need to enter their registered email and password to log in.

For extra security, the login system includes multi-factor authentication (MFA). After entering the correct email and password, a verification code is sent to the userâ€™s registered phone or email. This ensures that only the rightful user can access the account.

If a user forgets their password, they can reset it using the "Forgot Password" option. A reset link is sent to their email, allowing them to create a new password easily.
